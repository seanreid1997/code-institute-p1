            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first mention of the site was in the Domesday Book of 1086 as part of the Manor of Eaton.
            Browne Willis built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down.
            It was first known as Bletchley Park after it was purchased by the architect Samuel Lipscomb Seckham in 1877, who built a house there.
            The estate was bought in 1883 by Sir Herbert Samuel Leon. 
            He expanded the house combining Tudor, Dutch Baroque, and Victorian Gothic styles. 
            After the death of Herbert Leon in 1926, the estate continued to be occupied by his widow Fanny Leon until her death in 1937.
            In 1938, the mansion as well as much of the site was bought by a builder for a housing estate, but in May that year Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair, head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6), bought the mansion and 58 acres of land.
            He used his own money, £6,000 (the equivolent of approximately £392,000 today), as the Government couldn't afford to help.
            He purchased the property with the intended use by GC&CS and SIS in the event of war due to it's geographical advantage. 
            It was almost immediately adjacent to the Bletchley railway station, where the "Varsity Line" between Oxford and Cambridge, met the main West Coast railway line connecting London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
            These universities of Oxford and Cambridge were expected to provide many of the code-breakers.
            Watling Street, the main road linking London to the north-west was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby Fenny Stratford.
            Bletchley Park was known as "B.P." to those who worked there.
            "Station X" (initially a wireless room established at Bletchley Park at the mansions water tower), "London Signals Intelligence Centre", and "Government Communications Headquarters" were all covers used during the war.
            The formal posting of the many members of the Women's Royal Naval Service working there, was to HMS Pembroke V. 
            Bletchley Park and its outstations were given names by The Royal Air Force including RAF Eastcote, RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green.
            The postal address that staff had to use was "Room 47, Foreign Office".</p>

        <div>
            <p>The first personnel of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. 
            The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were located on the ground floor of the mansion. 
            Located there was also a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room. 
            MI6 was allocated to the top floor. 
            In late 1939 the construction of the wooden huts began and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.
            After the United States joined World War II, a number of American cryptographers were posted to Hut 3, and from May 1943 there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.
            The Soviet Union was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities. 
            This was due to Winston Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance against the Nazi threat.
            The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 20-21 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for Bletchley railway station.
            Hut 4 had shifted two feet from its foundation, but was winched back into place as work inside continued. 
            Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, "Station X" was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby Whaddon Hall to avoid drawing attention to the site.
            Subsequently, other listening stations, the Y-stations, such as the ones at Chicksands in Bedfordshire, Beaumanor Hall, Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office "Y" Group was located) and Beeston Hill Y Station in Norfolk, gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley.
            Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle despatch riders and by teleprinter.</p>

            <h2>Secrecy</h2>
            <p>After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work.
            That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.
            With the publication of F. W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret (1974) public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible.
            Up to this day some former staff still consider themselves bound to secrecy. 
            in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.</p><br>

        <h2>After The War</h2>
        <p>After the war, the Government Code & Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), moving to Eastcote in 1946 and to Cheltenham in the 1950s.
            The site was used by many government agencies, including the GPO and the Civil Aviation Authority. 
            Block F, was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving.
            In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development, however, Milton Keynes Council made it into a conservation area. 
            Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who still recognised the importance of the site. 
            The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, Peter Wescombe, Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological & Historical Society, and Tony Sale.
            Tony Sale then became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums in 1994. 
            The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by the Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994.
            In 1999 the land owners, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and BT, granted a lease to the Trust giving it control over most of the site.
            June 2014 saw the completion of an £8 million restoration project by museum design specialist, Event Communications, which was marked by a visit from Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.
            <br>
            A memorial at Bletchley Park commemorates Mary and Valerie Middleton's work as code-breakers.
            The Duchess' paternal grandmother, Valerie, and Valerie's twin sister, Mary, both worked at Bletchley Park during the war. 
            The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in Hut 6, where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption.
            Valerie married Catherine's grandfather, Captain Peter Middleton.</p>
